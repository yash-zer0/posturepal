# ExercisePoseCorrection üî• üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This project implements a real-time fitness tracking and posture correction system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It focuses on detecting and classifying three key exercises‚Äîpush-ups, squats, and bicep curls‚Äîwhile providing real-time feedback on exercise form.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
#### 1. Data Collection & Model Training

   Videos of excercises were recorded at 60fps, the frames were then extracted using a simple python script, finally annotation and data augmentation was done with the help of roboflow

Dataset was split into 70% training, 20% validation and 10% Test sets and was then trained using YOLOv8 for robust and fast excercise detection 

#### 2. Model Training Results

  We were able to achieve a Precision of 99%, Recall 89% and mAP50-95 score of 92.7%
       

#### 3. Pose Estimation & Form Analysis

  MediaPipe Pose was used to identify the body landmarks, upoun which depending on the type of excercise classified a logic was using to determine if the posture is correct or not
        ‚Ä¢Push-Ups: Detect up/down phases and evaluate back alignment.
        ‚Ä¢Squats: Analyze knee alignment, shoulder-to-knee posture, and back angle.
        ‚Ä¢Bicep Curls: Assess elbow movement and shoulder stability.

#### 4. Deployment
  Streamlit was used to deploy the model with three modes of input (Webcam, DroidCam and Video Uploads) to allow real time feedback 

#### 5. Demo
